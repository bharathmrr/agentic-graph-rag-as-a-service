# 🚀 Quick Start Guide

## ✅ Problem Fixed!
The "404 Not Found" errors were caused by missing API endpoints. I've added the required endpoints to fix this issue.

## 🎯 How to Start the Application

### Option 1: Start Everything at Once
```bash
# Windows Batch
start_all.bat

# Windows PowerShell  
.\start_all.ps1
```

### Option 2: Start Backend and Frontend Separately

#### 1. Start Backend Server
```bash
# Windows Batch
runserver.bat

# Windows PowerShell
.\runserver.ps1

# Or directly
python runserver.py
```

#### 2. Start Frontend (in a new terminal)
```bash
# Windows Batch
start_frontend.bat

# Windows PowerShell
.\start_frontend.ps1

# Or manually
cd frontend
npm start
```

## 🌐 Access Points

- **Frontend**: http://localhost:3000
- **Backend API**: http://127.0.0.1:8000
- **API Documentation**: http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs
- **Health Check**: http://127.0.0.1:8000/health

## ✅ Fixed Issues

1. **404 Not Found Errors**: Added missing `/api/sse/progress` endpoint
2. **Documents API**: Added `/api/documents` endpoint
3. **CORS Headers**: Properly configured for frontend-backend communication
4. **Server-Sent Events**: SSE endpoint now working for real-time updates

## 🎉 Features Working

- ✅ **Upload File Generator Alert**: Shows when clicking modules without uploaded files
- ✅ **Beautiful Data Display**: Modern interface after upload completion
- ✅ **Core Modules Dashboard**: Professional module management
- ✅ **Real-time Updates**: SSE connection for live progress
- ✅ **Backend API**: All endpoints responding correctly

## 🚀 Usage Flow

1. **Start Servers**: Run `start_all.bat` or start separately
2. **Open Browser**: Navigate to http://localhost:3000
3. **Upload Documents**: Click "Upload Documents" module
4. **Process Files**: Upload and wait for beautiful data display
5. **Explore Modules**: Access all core modules after upload
6. **Knowledge Graph**: Interactive visualization available

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### If you still see 404 errors:
1. Make sure you're using the updated `test_server.py`
2. Restart the backend server
3. Check that all endpoints are responding

### If frontend won't start:
1. Make sure Node.js is installed
2. Run `npm install` in the frontend directory
3. Check that port 3000 is available

## 🎯 Success Indicators

- ✅ Backend: "Server is running" at http://127.0.0.1:8000/health
- ✅ Frontend: React app loads at http://localhost:3000
- ✅ No 404 errors in browser console
- ✅ Upload alert appears when clicking modules
- ✅ Beautiful data display after upload

The application is now fully functional! 🎉
